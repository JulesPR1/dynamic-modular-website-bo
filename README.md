# Dynamic modular website back-office with Strapi
## Work in progress

This project is a back-office for a dynamic modular website. It is built with Strapi, a headless CMS, and a [Rails application](https://github.com/JulesPR1/dynamic-modular-site-front) use the API provided to display the customized website content.

What is special about this back-office is that it offers the possibility to move front-end components easily. For example, if you want to move the "About us" section from the bottom of the page to the top, you just have to change the order of the components in the back-office. The [Rails application](https://github.com/JulesPR1/dynamic-modular-site-front) will then display the components in the right order.
